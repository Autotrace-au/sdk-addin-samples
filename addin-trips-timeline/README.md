# addin-trips-timeline

This add-in demonstrates a compact visualization of the times vehicles made their trips throughout the day using [vis.js](http://visjs.org/). Scroll through the trips taken by the vehicles over time in a grid format which shows the start and stop of the trip. Selection can be narrowed down based on groups. The user can then select a particular trip and view the trip history of that vehicle for the day selected.
